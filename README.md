================

"Reto1" is an educational simulation in HTML5, by <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/" target="_blank">PhET Interactive Simulations</a>
at the University of Colorado Boulder.

*This simulation is under development and has not been published.*

### About this sim

"Reto1" provide a simple simulation for a one dimention movement of a Robot "build" with Technics Legos. The name of the robot is called Bahazy, that means clean from a Colombia indigenus comunity.

This was made for basic grades 7Â° to practice mathematical concepts ( direc proportion, diameter, perimeter) by a STEM enviroment with the univerisity Uniminuto (stem, pcis, uniminuto.edu.co)

This sim was made by following the Phet Sims documentation, below. Using keypad, Vector2, Image, Node, AlertDialog, MeasuringTapeNode  and others librarys from PhetSims project.
